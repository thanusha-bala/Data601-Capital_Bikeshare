# Data601-Capital_Bikeshare

**Project Title:** Weather or Time? Understanding What Drives Capital Bikeshare Usage 

**Project Author:** Thanusha Balasubramanian 

**Course:** Data 601 - Fall 2025 

**Project Overview:** 

This project seeks to answer the following question: Which variables have the greatest impact on hourly Capital Bikeshare usage? We wish to find the top 5 features with greatest magnitude of positive or negative impact on hourly bikeshare usage. 

To answer the guiding question, an EDA was performed using python pandas, and seasborn. After the EDA both a linear regression model and a decision tree classfication model were ran to identify the most important features impacting capital bike share usage.
